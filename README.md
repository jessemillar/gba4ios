My own build/fork of GBA4iOS that allows easy sideloading on iOS 9 and Xcode 7.

To install, run `sudo gem install cocoapods; git clone https://github.com/jessemillar/GBA4iOS.git; cd GBA4iOS; pod install`

If you encounter issues, follow the instructions at the bottom of [this site](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/).

This repository has been set up per these instructions:
